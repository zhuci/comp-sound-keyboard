        I focused mainly on the "Model" and "Method" sections of the textbook 
        for the R2D2 robotic chatter. To make these "babbling computer noises", 
        the "Model" section instructs to "completely randomise the parameter space 
        of a simple synthesizer". Basically, I did FM synthesis (as suggested by the 
        "Method" section) with randomized parameters. I randomized the carrier 
        frequencey, period, modulator index, modulator frequency, and waveform. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For the FM synthesis, I modified by code from HW 2 and created a FMPlayNote
        function which takes in the random parameters and plays a certain sound for 
        the time specified. Since we want only one oscilator at once and sounds to be 
        one after another, I had my FMPlayNote function take a start and stop time that
        was based on the current time + the random period that accumulates as the sounds 
        continue so we can prevent oscilator overlap. Technically, you could have more 
        than 1 robot chatter at once if you press play again. I also have it stopping after
        a certain amount (not an infinite loop - wanted to do something similar to the Brook
        where the code runs and then the button starts and stops the audio context, but it was
        freezing my browser).

        The book says that we can "drive the modulation and index values well outside 
        the normal range to deliberately introduce foldover aliasing", so I played around
        with these variables and increased the upper bound. I also made the period go 
        from 0 to 0.25 and adjusted the carrier frequency bounds based on how the 
        <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/8375/designing_sound.zip/practical34.html">reference</a>
        sounded.

        Above is a screen shot of FM synthesis from the professor's slide. I wanted to 
        get a screenshot of my webaudio, but nothing was showing up (for this and other
        examples). But in essence, this R2D2 is just the same as the FM synthesis from 
        before, with the Modulator Oscillator node connected to the Modulator Index 
        gain node connected to a global gain (not shown here) connecting to the audio
        destination.
