  <h1>Cindy's Lab 4 Part 1</h1>
  <p> This live coding language is modified from Prof. Santolucito's, which was a minimal command-based live coding engine. 
    I have added 3 new features:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Waveform Type: Sine, Sawtooth, Square, Triangle</li>
    <li>Rests: Pitches that are 0Hz will be as rests for the lenght specified </li>
    <li>Amplitude: Can be specified between 0 and 1, defaults to 0.75</li>
  </ol>
  <p> To use the live coding engine, press the button to re-evaluate your code.
  This language allows you to specify a rhythmic pattern of beats by entering a space-separated list of times and pitches and amplitude (optional). 
  You can also specify the type of waveform at the beginning of the code or it'll default to sine
  You can also include javascript computation in the values.
  As an example:
  </p>
  <p>triangle 1+1@220@0.25 3@0 2@220*2 1*3@270</p>
  <textarea id="code" rows="4" cols="50"></textarea>
